# WTF zk Tutorial Lesson 27: Finite Field

In this chapter, we will introduce finite fields (also known as Galois fields), which are fields that contain a finite number of elements. They are often used in cryptography and zero-knowledge proof algorithms.

## 1. Finite Field

A finite field, also known as a Galois field (named after [Galois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89variste_Galois), the founder of modern group theory), is a field that contains a finite number of elements. We usually denote a finite field with $GF(q)$ or $F_q$, where $q$ is the number of elements in the field.

**Property 1: The number of elements in a finite field can only be a prime number $p$ or a power of a prime $p^n$.** A field with $p$ elements is called a prime field, and a field with $p^n$ elements is called an extension field of the prime field.

## 2. Prime Field

The most common type of finite field is the prime field $GF(p)$ (also written as $F_p$), which is the field of integers modulo $p$. This type of finite field is also called a prime field. You can think of a prime field as the remainder classes of integers modulo $p$, where addition and multiplication are performed modulo $p$.

For example, the finite field $GF(2)$ (also written as $F_2$) contains two elements $\{0, 1\}$, which can represent 1 bit. Its addition table and multiplication table are as follows:

**$GF(2)$ addition table**

| + | 0 | 1 | 
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |

**$GF(2)$ multiplication table**

| · | 0 | 1 |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |

Another example is the finite field $GF(3)$, which contains three elements $\{0,1,2\}$. Its addition table and multiplication table are as follows:

**$GF(3)$ addition table**

| + | 0 | 1 | 2 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 |
| 1 | 1 | 2 | 0 |
| 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 |

**$GF(3)$ multiplication table**

| · | 0 | 1 | 2 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 |
| 2 | 0 | 2 | 1 |

Here are some properties of prime fields:

**Property 2: The characteristic of a prime field $F_p$ is $p$.** This means that $1 \cdot p = 0$, and any element multiplied by $p$ is also equal to the zero element.

For example, the characteristic of $F_p$ is $3$, and we have

$$
0 \cdot 3 = 0 \pmod{3}
$$

$$
1 \cdot 3 = 0 \pmod{3}
$$

$$
2 \cdot 3 = 0 \pmod{3}
$$

**Property 3: Any finite field with $p$ elements is isomorphic to the prime field $F_p$.**

This means that we can use the prime field $F_p$ to study other finite fields with $p$ elements, as they are essentially the same.

## 3. Field Extension

A field extension of a prime field is a field of order $p^n$, where $p^n$ is a power of a prime, and it extends the prime field $F_p$.

**Construction Method:** Suppose $F_p$ is a prime field, $f(x)$ is an irreducible polynomial of degree $n$ over $F_p$, and $(f(x))$ is the principal ideal generated by $f(x)$. Then, the quotient ring $F_{p^n} = F[x]/(f(x))$ is a finite field of order $p^n$, consisting of all polynomials of degree less than $n$ in the polynomial ring $F[x]$:

$$
F_{p^n} = \{a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_0 | a_i \in F_p\}
$$

Addition in the finite field $F_{p^n}$ is performed in the polynomial ring, and multiplication is performed in the polynomial ring followed by division by the irreducible polynomial $f(x)$ to ensure that the degree of the result does not exceed $n$.

Since each coefficient of a polynomial in the finite field $F_{p^n}$ has $p$ choices, and there are $n$ coefficients in total, $F_{p^n}$ has a total of $p^n$ elements.

Also, since each coefficient belongs to $Z_p$, the characteristic of the finite field $F_{p^n}$ is $p$.

For example, let's construct the finite field $F_4$. Since $4 = 2^2$, we construct it using $F_2 = \{0,1\}$. First, we find an irreducible polynomial of degree 2 from the polynomial ring $F_2[x]$:

$$
x^2 + x + 1
$$

Then, we construct the quotient ring $F_2[x]/(x^2 + x + 1)$, which is $F_4$, where the elements are the equivalence classes of polynomials in $F_2[x]$ that are congruent to $x^2 + x + 1$.

The elements in this finite field can be represented as $a + b \alpha$, where $a, b \in F_2$ and $\alpha$ is a root of $x^2 + x + 1$. The constructed finite field can be represented as:

$$
\{0, 1, \alpha, 1 + \alpha\}
$$

Originally, it was $\{0, 1, \alpha, \alpha^2\}$, but $\alpha^2 = -\alpha -1 = \alpha + 1$. The addition and multiplication operations in the finite field $F_4$ are performed in $F_2[x]/(x^2 + x + 1)$, modulo the congruence relation of $x^2 + x + 1$.

## 4. Code Implementation

We can use the `galois` package to implement finite fields in Python. In the following program, we construct a finite field $GF(4)$ and print its properties, elements, addition table, and multiplication table:

```python
import galois

GF4 = galois.GF(4)
print("Properties of the finite field GF(4):", GF4.properties)
print("Elements of the finite field GF(4):", GF4.elements)

print("Addition table of the finite field GF(4)")
print(GF7.arithmetic_table("+"))
print("Multiplication table of the finite field GF(4)")
print(GF7.arithmetic_table("*"))

## Output Example

```

## 5. Summary

In this chapter, we introduced finite fields, which are the most commonly used mathematical structures in cryptography and zero-knowledge proofs. Finite fields include prime fields and their extension fields: a prime field $F_p$ is the simplest type of finite field, consisting of $p$ elements; a field extension of the prime field contains $q^n$ elements, constructed based on the prime field $F_p$ and an irreducible polynomial.
