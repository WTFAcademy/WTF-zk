# WTF zk Tutorial Milestone 02: Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm

In this lesson, we will cover Milestone 02 of the WTF zk Zero Knowledge Proof tutorial. By now, you should have a good understanding of number theory and group theory. In this milestone, we will learn about the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm, which is a method for sharing keys over an insecure communication channel. This algorithm is a fundamental building block of cryptography and provides the foundation for secure communication.

## 1. Background

The Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm was first proposed by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in 1976. It is a public key cryptographic algorithm that allows two remote users to establish a shared key without actually sharing the key itself.

- **Public Key Cryptography:** The Diffie-Hellman algorithm was the first public key cryptography algorithm, which revolutionized the traditional method of sharing keys and laid the foundation for modern secure communication.

- **Security:** Based on the difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem, the two parties can securely negotiate a shared key without revealing their private keys.

- **Wide Applications:** The Diffie-Hellman algorithm is widely used in the field of secure communication, including protocols such as TLS/SSL and SSH.

## 2. Algorithm Principles

The core idea of the Diffie-Hellman algorithm is to utilize the difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem. Given a large prime number `p`, a base `g`, and `A â‰¡ g^a mod p`, it is computationally difficult to determine the value of `a`. The algorithm can be summarized in the following steps:

### 2.1 Key Generation

1. **Parameter Selection:** Choose two large prime numbers `p` and its primitive root (generator) `g`. Both `p` and `g` are public information.
2. **Private Key Generation:** Each party selects a private key. Let's say Alice chooses private key `a` and Bob chooses private key `b`. Both `a` and `b` are kept secret.
3. **Compute Public Key:** Alice computes `A = g^a mod p`, and Bob computes `B = g^b mod p`.
4. **Exchange Public Keys:** Alice sends `A` to Bob, and Bob sends `B` to Alice. At this point, both `A` and `B` are public.

In this step, the public keys `p`, `g`, `A`, and `B` are public, while the private keys `a` and `b` are kept secret.

### 2.2 Key Agreement

1. **Compute Session Key:** After receiving Bob's public key `B`, Alice computes `K = B^a mod p`. Similarly, after receiving Alice's public key `A`, Bob computes `K = A^b mod p`.
2. **Generate Shared Key:** Alice and Bob now have the same key `K`, which can be used as a session key for encrypted communication. Since an eavesdropper does not have access to `a` and `b`, it is computationally infeasible to calculate `K`, making the key `K` secure.

## 3. Example

To better understand the Diffie-Hellman algorithm, let's walk through a simple example.

1. **Parameter Selection:** Choose the prime number `p = 13` and its primitive root `g = 6`.
2. **Private Key Generation:** Alice chooses private key `a = 5`, and Bob chooses private key `b = 4`.
3. **Compute Public Key:** Alice computes `A = 6^5 = 2 mod 13`, and Bob computes `B = 6^4 = 9 mod 13`.
4. **Exchange Public Keys:** Alice sends `A = 2` to Bob, and Bob sends `B = 9` to Alice.
5. **Compute Session Key:** Alice computes `K = 9^5 mod 13 = 3`, and Bob computes `K = 2^4 mod 13 = 3`.
6. **Generate Shared Key:** Alice and Bob now have the same shared key `K = 3`, which can be used for further encrypted communication.

## 4. Algorithm Logic

The security of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm is based on the difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem. For an eavesdropper, the only information available is the prime number `p`, the primitive root `g`, Alice's public key `A = g^a mod p`, and Bob's public key `B = g^b mod p`. In order to obtain the shared key `K = g^(ab) mod p`, the eavesdropper needs to compute `a = log_g(A)` or `b = log_g(B)`, which is the discrete logarithm problem. However, there is no efficient algorithm for solving this problem, making it computationally infeasible. Therefore, the Diffie-Hellman algorithm is secure.

Additionally, since `p` is a large prime number, the order (number of elements) of the multiplicative group `Z^*_p` modulo `p` is `p-1`, which is very large. As the primitive root `g` is a generator of `Z^*_p`, its powers can cover all elements in `Z^*_p`, making it difficult to break the discrete logarithm problem by brute force.

## 5. Code Implementation

Here is a simple implementation in Python that demonstrates the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm:

```python
import random

def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def modinv(a, b):
    m0, x0, x1 = b, 0, 1
    while a > 1:
        q = a // b
        a, b = b, a % b
        x0, x1 = x1 - q * x0, x0
    return x1 + m0 if x1 < 0 else x1

def generate_params():
    p = random_prime()
    g = random.randint(2, p - 2)
    return p, g

def generate_private_key():
    return random.randint(2, 2**16)

def generate_public_key(private_key, p, g):
    return pow(g, private_key, p)

def generate_shared_secret(private_key, public_key, p):
    return pow(public_key, private_key, p)

def random_prime():
    while True:
        num = random.randint(10**3, 10**4)
        if is_prime(num):
            return num

# Example
p, g = generate_params()
alice_private_key = generate_private_key()
bob_private_key = generate_private_key()

alice_public_key = generate_public_key(alice_private_key, p, g)
bob_public_key = generate_public_key(bob_private_key, p, g)

alice_shared_secret = generate_shared_secret(alice_private_key, bob_public_key, p)
bob_shared_secret = generate_shared_secret(bob_private_key, alice_public_key, p)

print("Prime number (p):", p)
print("Primitive root/generator (g):", g)
print("Alice's private key:", alice_private_key)
print("Bob's private key:", bob_private_key)
print("Alice's public key:", alice_public_key)
print("Bob's public key:", bob_public_key)
print("Shared secret (Alice):", alice_shared_secret)
print("Shared secret (Bob):", bob_shared_secret)

## Output Example
# Prime number (p): 2707
# Primitive root/generator (g): 1620
# Alice's private key: 8706
# Bob's private key: 60566
# Alice's public key: 1183
# Bob's public key: 2369
# Shared secret (Alice): 1776
# Shared secret (Bob): 1776
```
